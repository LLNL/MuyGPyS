Distance functions

Compute pairwise and crosswise distance tensors for the purposes of kernel
construction.

See the following example computing the pairwise and crosswise distances between
a batch of training data and their nearest neighbors.

Example:
    >>> from MuyGPyS.neighbors import NN_Wrapper
    >>> from MuyGPyS.optimize.batch import sample_batch
    >>> from MuyGPyS.gp.distance import crosswise_distances
    >>> train_features = load_train_features()
    >>> nn_count = 10
    >>> nbrs_lookup = NN_Wrapper(
    ...         train_features, nn_count, nn_method="exact", algorithm="ball_tree"
    ... )
    >>> train_count, _ = train_features.shape
    >>> batch_count = 50
    >>> batch_indices, batch_nn_indices = sample_batch(
    ...         nbrs_lookup, batch_count, train_count
    ... )
    >>> pairwise_dists = pairwise_distances(
    ...         train_features, batch_nn_inidices, metric="l2"
    ... )
    >>> crosswise_dists = crosswise_distances(
    ...         train_features,
    ...         train_features,
    ...         batch_indices,
    ...         batch_nn_indices,
    ...         metric="l2",
    ... )
    )

See also the following example computing the crosswise distances between a
test dataset and their nearest neighors in the training data.

Example:
    >>> from MuyGPyS.neighbors import NN_Wrapper
    >>> from MuyGPyS.gp.distance import crosswise_distances
    >>> train_features = load_train_features()
    >>> test_features = load_test_features()
    >>> nn_count = 10
    >>> nbrs_lookup = NN_Wrapper(
    ...         train_features, nn_count, nn_method="exact", algorithm="ball_tree"
    ... )
    >>> nn_indices, nn_dists = nbrs_lookup.get_nns(test_features)
    >>> test_count, _ = test_features.shape
    >>> indices = np.arange(test_count)
    >>> nn_indices, _ = nbrs_lookup.get_nns(test_features)
    >>> pairwise_dists = pairwise_distances(
    ...         train_features, nn_inidices, metric="l2"
    ... )
    >>> crosswise_dists = crosswise_distances(
    ...         test_features,
    ...         train_features,
    ...         indices,
    ...         nn_indices,
    ...         metric="l2"
    ... )

The helper functions :func:`MuyGPyS.gp.distance.make_regress_tensors` and
:func:`MuyGPyS.gp.distance.make_train_tensors` wrap these distances tensors and
also return the nearest neighbors sets' training targets and (in the latter
case) the training targets of the training batch. These functions are convenient
as the distance and target tensors are usually needed together.
