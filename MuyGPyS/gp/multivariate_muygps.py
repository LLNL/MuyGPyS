class MultivariateMuyGPS:
    """
    Multivariate Local Kriging Gaussian Process.

    Performs approximate GP inference by locally approximating an observation's
    response using its nearest neighbors with a separate kernel allocated for
    each response dimension, implemented as individual
    :class:`MuyGPyS.gp.muygps.MuyGPS` objects.

    This class is similar in interface to :class:`MuyGPyS.gp.muygps.MuyGPS`, but
    requires a list of hyperparameter dicts at initialization.

    Example:
        >>> from MuyGPyS.gp import MultivariateMuyGPS as MMuyGPS
        >>> k_kwargs1 = {
        ...     "noise": Parameter(1e-5),

        ...         smoothness=Parameter(0.67, (0.1, 2.5)),
        ...         deformation=Isotropy(
        ...             metric=l2,
        ...             length_scale=Parameter(0.2),
        ...         scale=AnalyticScale(),
        ...     ),
        ... }
        >>> k_kwargs2 = {
        ...     "noise": Parameter(1e-5),
        ...     "kernel": Matern(
        ...         smoothness=Parameter(0.67, (0.1, 2.5)),
        ...         deformation=Isotropy(
        ...             metric=l2,
        ...             length_scale=Parameter(0.2),

        >>> mmuygps = MMuyGPS(*k_args)

    We can realize kernel tensors for each of the models contained within a
    `MultivariateMuyGPS` object by iterating over its `models` member. Once we
    have computed `pairwise_diffs` and `crosswise_diffs` tensors, it
    is straightforward to perform each of these realizations.

    Example:
        >>> for model in MuyGPyS.models:
        >>>     K = model.kernel(pairwise_diffs)
        >>>     Kcross = model.kernel(crosswise_diffs)
