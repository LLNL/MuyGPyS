class MuyGPS:
    """
    Local Kriging Gaussian Process.

    Performs approximate GP inference by locally approximating an observation's
    response using its nearest neighbors. Implements the MuyGPs algorithm as
    articulated in [muyskens2021muygps]_.

    Kernels accept different hyperparameter dictionaries specifying
    hyperparameter settings. Keys can include `val` and `bounds`. `bounds` must
    be either a len == 2  iterable container whose elements are scalars in
    increasing order, or the string `fixed`. If `bounds == fixed` (the default
    behavior), the hyperparameter value will remain fixed during optimization.
    `val` must be either a scalar (within the range of the upper and lower
    bounds if given) or the strings `"sample"` or `log_sample"`, which will
    randomly sample a value within the range given by the bounds.

    In addition to individual kernel hyperparamters, each MuyGPS object also
    possesses a noise model, possibly with parameters, and a vector of
    :math:`\\sigma^2` indicating the scale parameter associated with the
    posterior variance of each dimension of the response.

    Example:
        >>> from MuyGPyS.gp import MuyGPS
        >>> muygps = MuyGPS(
        ...    kernel=Matern(
        ...        smoothness=Parameter(0.38, (0.1, 2.5)),
        ...        deformation=Isotropy(
        ...            metric=l2,
        ...            length_scale=Parameter(0.2),
        ...        ),
        ...    ),
        ...    noise=HomoscedasticNoise(1e-5),
        ...    scale=AnalyticScale(),
        ... )

    MuyGPyS depends upon linear operations on specially-constructed tensors in
    order to efficiently estimate GP realizations. One can use (see their
    documentation for details) :func:`MuyGPyS.gp.tensors.pairwise_tensor` to
    construct pairwise difference tensors and
    :func:`MuyGPyS.gp.tensors.crosswise_tensor` to produce crosswise diff
    tensors that `MuyGPS` can then use to construct kernel tensors and
    cross-covariance matrices, respectively.

    We can easily realize kernel tensors using a `MuyGPS` object's `kernel`
    functor once we have computed a `pairwise_diffs` tensor and a
    `crosswise_diffs` matrix.

    Example:
        >>> Kin = muygps.kernel(pairwise_diffs)
        >>> Kcross = muygps.kernel(crosswise_diffs)

            A noise model. Defines :math:`\\varepsilon` as referenced in
            `MuyGPS` functions.
        scale:
            A variance scale parameter. Defines :math:`\\sigma^2` as referenced
            in `MuyGPS` functions.

        Create the metric and target tensors needed for training.

        Similar to :func:`~MuyGPyS.gp.muygps.MuyGPS.make_predict_tensors` but
        returns the additional `batch_targets` matrix, which is only defined for
        a batch of training data.

        Args:
            batch_indices:
                A vector of integers of shape `(batch_count,)` identifying the
                training batch of observations to be approximated.
            batch_nn_indices:
                A matrix of integers of shape `(batch_count, nn_count)` listing the
                nearest neighbor indices for all observations in the batch.
            train_features:
                The full floating point training data matrix of shape
                `(train_count, ...)`.
            train_targets:
                A matrix of shape `(train_count, ...)` whose rows are
                vector-valued responses for each training element.

        Returns
        -------
        crosswise_tensor:
            A tensor of shape
            `(batch_count, nn_count) [+ (feature_count,)]` containing the
            crosswise distances or feature-dimension-wise differences
            (extra `feature_count` dimension) between the batch elements
            and each of their nearest neighbors. Shape depends on the
            deformation.
        pairwise_tensor:
            A tensor of shape
            `(batch_count, nn_count, nn_count) [+ (feature_count,)]`
            containing the pairwise distances or feature-dimension-wise
            differences (extra `feature_count` dimension) between all pairs
            of nearest neighbors for each batch element. Shape depends on the
            deformation.
        batch_targets:
            Matrix of floats of shape `(batch_count,) [+ (response_count,)`
            containing the (possibly multivariate) expected response for each
            batch element.
        batch_nn_targets:
            Tensor of floats of shape
            `(batch_count, nn_count) [+ (response_count,)]` containing the
            expected (possibly multivariate) response for each nearest
            neighbor of each batch element.
