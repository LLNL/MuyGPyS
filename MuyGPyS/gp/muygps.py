class MuyGPS:
    """
    Local Kriging Gaussian Process.

    Performs approximate GP inference by locally approximating an observation's
    response using its nearest neighbors. Implements the MuyGPs algorithm as
    articulated in [muyskens2021muygps]_.

    Kernels accept different hyperparameter dictionaries specifying
    hyperparameter settings. Keys can include `val` and `bounds`. `bounds` must
    be either a len == 2  iterable container whose elements are scalars in
    increasing order, or the string `fixed`. If `bounds == fixed` (the default
    behavior), the hyperparameter value will remain fixed during optimization.
    `val` must be either a scalar (within the range of the upper and lower
    bounds if given) or the strings `"sample"` or `log_sample"`, which will
    randomly sample a value within the range given by the bounds.

    In addition to individual kernel hyperparamters, each MuyGPS object also
    possesses a homoscedastic :math:`\\varepsilon` noise parameter and a
    vector of :math:`\\sigma^2` indicating the scale parameter associated
    with the posterior variance of each dimension of the response.

    :math:`\\sigma^2` is the only parameter assumed to be a training target by
    default, and is treated differently from all other hyperparameters. All
    other training targets must be manually specified in `k_kwargs`.

    Example:
        >>> from MuyGPyS.gp.muygps import MuyGPS
        >>> k_kwargs = {
        ...         "kern": "rbf",
        ...         "metric": "F2",
        ...         "eps": {"val": 1e-5},
        ...         "nu": {"val": 0.38, "bounds": (0.1, 2.5)},
        ...         "length_scale": {"val": 7.2},
        ... }
        >>> muygps = MuyGPS(**k_kwarg)

    MuyGPyS depends upon linear operations on specially-constructed tensors in
    order to efficiently estimate GP realizations. One can use (see their
    documentation for details) :func:`MuyGPyS.gp.distance.pairwise_distances` to
    construct pairwise distance tensors and
    :func:`MuyGPyS.gp.distance.crosswise_distances` to produce crosswise distance
    matrices that `MuyGPS` can then use to construct kernel tensors and
    cross-covariance matrices, respectively.

    We can easily realize kernel tensors using a `MuyGPS` object's `kernel`
    functor once we have computed a `pairwise_dists` tensor and a
    `crosswise_dists` matrix.

    Example:
        >>> K = muygps.kernel(pairwise_dists)
        >>> Kcross = muygps.kernel(crosswise_dists)

class MultivariateMuyGPS:

    Multivariate Local Kriging Gaussian Process.

    Performs approximate GP inference by locally approximating an observation's
    response using its nearest neighbors with a separate kernel allocated for
    each response dimension, implemented as individual
    :class:`MuyGPyS.gp.muygps.MuyGPS` objects.

    This class is similar in interface to :class:`MuyGPyS.gp.muygps.MuyGPS`, but
    requires a list of hyperparameter dicts at initialization.

    Example:
        >>> from MuyGPyS.gp.muygps import MultivariateMuyGPS as MMuyGPS
        >>> k_kwargs1 = {
        ...         "eps": {"val": 1e-5},

    `MultivariateMuyGPS` object by iterating over its `models` member. Once we
    have computed a `pairwise_dists` tensor and a `crosswise_dists` matrix, it
    is straightforward to perform each of these realizations.
