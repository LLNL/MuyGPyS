KNN lookup management

`MuyGPyS.neighbors.NN_Wrapper` is an api for tasking several KNN libraries with
the construction of lookup indexes that empower fast training and inference.
The wrapper constructor expects the training features, the number of nearest
neighbors, and a method string specifying which algorithm to use, as well as any
additional kwargs used by the methods.
Currently supported implementations include exact KNN using
`sklearn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors.html>`_
("exact") and approximate KNN using `hnsw <https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib>`_
("hnsw").

    Nearest Neighbors lookup datastructure wrapper.

    Wraps the logic driving nearest neighbor data structure training and
    querying. Currently supports `sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors` for exact
    computation and `hnswlib.Index` for approximate nearest neighbors.

    An example constructing exact and approximate KNN data lookups with k = 10.

    Example:
        >>> from MuyGPyS.neighors import NN_Wrapper
        >>> train_features = load_train_features()
        >>> nn_count = 10
        >>> exact_nbrs_lookup = NN_Wrapper(

        nn_count:
            The number of nearest neighbors to return in queries.
        nn_method:
            Indicates which nearest neighbor algorithm should be used.
            Currently "exact" indicates `sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors`,
            while "hnsw" indicates `hnswlib.Index` (requires installing MuyGPyS
            with the "hnswlib" extras flag).

            Additional kwargs used for lookup data structure construction.
            `nn_method="exact"` supports "radius", "algorithm", "leaf_size",
            "metric", "p", "metric_params", and "n_jobs" kwargs.
            `nn_method="hnsw"` supports "space", "ef_construction", "M", and
            "random_seed" kwargs.
