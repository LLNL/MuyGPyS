# Fast implementation of the MuyGPs Gaussian process hyperparameter estimation algorithm


MuyGPs is a GP estimation method that affords fast hyperparameter optimization 
by way of performing leave-one-out cross-validation.
MuyGPs achieves best-in-class speed and scalability by limiting inference to the information contained in k nearest neighborhoods for prediction locations for 
both hyperparameter optimization and tuning.
This feature affords the optimization of hyperparameters by way of leave-one-out cross-validation, as opposed to the more expensive loglikelihood evaluations 
required by similar sparse methods. 


## Just-In-Time Compiled or Numpy?

With release v0.5.0, `MuyGPyS` supports just-in-time compilation of the 
underlying math functions to CPU or GPU using 
[JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).
The JAX-compiled versions of the code are significantly faster, especially on 
GPUs.
Both pure numpy and JAX-compiled versions of the library are supported, with 
most users specifying at install-time whether to use JAX.
See the below installation instructions.

If for some reason you want to swap between numpy and JAX implementations (and
have installed the JAX dependencies as below), `MuyGPyS.config` allows this.
Note that deactivating JAX must happen prior to importing any other `MuyGPyS`
functions.
```
from MuyGPyS import config

config.disable_jax()

# subsequent imports...
```

### Precision

JAX uses 32 bit types by default, whereas numpy tends to promote everything to
64 bits.
For highly stable operations like matrix multiplication, this difference in
precision tends to result in a roughly `1e-8` disagreement between 64 bit and 32
bit implementations.
However, `MuyGPyS` depends upon matrix-vector solves, which can result in
disagreements up to `1e-2`.
In order to ensure that the numpy and JAX implementations agree, `MuyGPyS`
forces JAX to use 64 bit types by default.

However, the 64 bit operations are slightly slower than their 32 bit
counterparts.
It is possible for a user to switch to 32 bit types and functions in their JAX
compiled code by either directly manipulating JAX's configuration or using
`MuyGPyS.config` as follows:
```
from MuyGPyS import config

config.jax_enable_x64()
# equivalent to jax.config.update("jax_enable_x64", True)
```
If confused, you can also query for whether 64 bit types are enabled via
`config.x64_enabled()`, which returns a boolean.

## Installation

### Pip: CPU

The index `muygpys` is maintained on PyPI and can be installed using `pip`.
`muygps` supports many optional extras flags, which will install additional
dependencies if specified. 
If installing CPU-only with pip, you might want to consider the following flags:  
These extras include:
- `hnswlib` - install [hnswlib](https://github.com/nmslib/hnswlib) dependency to
support fast approximate nearest neighbors indexing
- `jax_cpu` - install [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) dependencies to 
support just-in-time compilation of math functions on CPU (see below to install
on GPU CUDA architectures)
```
$ # numpy-only installation. Functions will internally use numpy.
$ pip install --upgrade muygpys
$ # The same, but includes hnswlib.
$ pip install --upgrade muygpys[hnswlib]
$ # CPU-only JAX installation. Functions will be jit-compiled using JAX.
$ pip install --upgrade muygpys[jax_cpu]
$ # The same, but includes hnswlib.
$ pip install --upgrade muygpys[jax_cpu,hnswlib]
```

### Pip: GPU (CUDA)

[JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) also supports just-in-time compilation to
CUDA, making the compiled math functions within `MuyGPyS` runnable on NVidia 
GPUS.
This requires you to install 
[CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
and 
[CuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/CUDNN)
in your environment, if they are not already installed, and to ensure that they
are on your environment's `$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. 
See [scripts](scripts/lc-setup/pascal.sh) for an example environment setup.

JAX currently supports CUDA 11.1 or newer, and CuDNN 8.0.5 or newer or CuDNN 8.2 
or newer. 
We will attempt to keep the `muygpys` PyPI index up to date with JAX, but any 
significant installation changes may result in a lag in automated installation 
support.
Consider reading the 
[JAX CUDA installation instructions](https://github.com/google/jax#pip-installation-gpu-cuda)
for more information.

Installing `muygpys` with NVidia GPU support requires indicating the location 
for JAX's pre-built wheels, as well as specifying the versions of CUDA and CuDNN
installed in your environment with one of the following extras flags:
- `jax_cuda11_cudnn82`
- `jax_cuda11_cudnn805`
- `jax_cuda` (shorthand for `jax_cuda11_cudnn805`)
```
$ # CUDA >= 11.1 and CuDNN >= 8.2
$ pip install muygpys[jax_cuda11_cudnn82] -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_releases.html
$ # CUDA >= 11.1 and CuDNN >= 8.0.5
$ pip install muygpys[jax_cuda11_cudnn805] -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_releases.html
$ # alternately, 
$ pip install muygpys[jax_cuda] -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_releases.html
```


### From Source

In order to build the docs locally, first `pip` install from source using either 
the `docs` or `dev` options and then execute:
```
$ sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build/html
```
Finally, open the file `docs/_build/html/index.html` in your browser of choice.


## Tutorials and Examples 

Our documentation includes several jupyter notebook tutorials at 
`docs/examples`.
These tutorials are also include in the 
[online documentation](https://muygpys.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

See in particular the 
[univariate regression tutorial](docs/examples/univariate_regression_tutorial.ipynb)
for a low-level introduction to the use of `MuyGPyS`.
See also the 
[regression api tutorial](docs/examples/regress_api_tutorial.ipynb)
describing how to coalesce the same simple workflow into a one-line call.


## Testing

In order to run tests locally, first `pip` install `MuyGPyS` from source using 
either the `dev` or `tests` options.
All tests in the `test/` directory are then runnable using python, e.g.

$ python tests/kernels.py
```

Individual `absl` unit test classes can be run in isolation, e.g.
```
$ python tests/kernels.py DistancesTest
```
